TrueOG Network is a 100% free and open source community-oriented Minecraft server. Inspired by the past, but not stuck in it, we bring the "OG" meta to the modern minecraft ecosystem via an expansive suite of [custom plugins](https://github.com/true-og/OG-Suite). The worlds of TrueOG SMP, which are a continuation of the worlds from OG SMP Season 1, will **never** be reset.

TrueOG Network is pre-release software. Our to-do list can be viewed [here](https://true-og.net/todo-list).

With the TrueOG Bootstrap, instead of beginning your minecraft server with a blank folder, you begin with a fully featured SMP and minigames stack, automatically built from source on a wide variety of operating systems. If TrueOG Network has a feature, your server can too, for free, forever.

Our admin team is structured as a unionized, democratic worker cooperative. We dedicte our in-house software to the public domain. This is done in rebellion to OG Network's selfish refusal to share their source code for OG:SMP Season 1, forcing TrueOG to be built from scratch, resulting in a long development period. We oppose TheMisterEpic's financial exploitation of children with pay-to-win gambling elements. As a worker-owned institution, we believe **community matters more than profit.**
