*ad astra per aspera*

TrueOG Network is a 100% free and open source community-oriented Minecraft server. Inspired by the past, but not stuck in it, we bring the "OG" meta to the modern minecraft ecosystem via an expansive suite of [custom plugins](https://github.com/true-og/OG-Suite). The worlds of TrueOG SMP, which are a continuation of the worlds from OG SMP Season 1, will **never** be reset.

TrueOG is pre-release software. Our to-do list can be viewed [here](https://true-og.net/todo-list).

The TrueOG Server bootstrap makes it *incredibly* easy to spin up your own server based on TrueOG's source code. Instead of beginning your journey with a blank plugins folder, you begin with a fully featured SMP and minigames server, which can be automatically built from source on a wide variety of operating systems.

Our admin team is structured as a unionized, democratic worker cooperative. We release everything possible into the public domain. Our dedication to these principles is re-enforced in rebellion against OG Network's selfish refusal to share their code for OG:SMP Season 1, forcing TrueOG to be built from scratch, resulting in a long development period. We oppose their financial exploitation of children with P2W gambling elements. At TrueOG Network, we believe players are greater than profit.**
