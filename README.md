TrueOG Network is a 100% free and open source community-oriented Minecraft server. Inspired by the past, but not stuck in it, we bring the "OG" meta to the modern minecraft ecosystem via an expansive suite of [custom plugins](https://github.com/true-og/OG-Suite). The worlds of TrueOG SMP, which are a continuation of the worlds from OG SMP Season 1, will **never** be reset.

You can also follow us on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@trueog">Mastodon</a>.

TrueOG Network is pre-release software. Our to-do list can be viewed [here](https://true-og.net/todo-list).

With the TrueOG Bootstrap, instead of beginning your minecraft server with a blank folder, you begin with a fully featured SMP and minigames stack, automatically built from source on a wide variety of operating systems. If TrueOG Network has a feature, your server can too, for free, forever.

Our admin team is structured as a unionized, democratic worker cooperative. We dedicte our in-house software to the public domain. This is done in rebellion to OG Network's selfish refusal to share their source code for OG:SMP Season 1, forcing TrueOG to be built from scratch, resulting in a long development period. We oppose TheMisterEpic's financial exploitation of children with pay-to-win gambling elements. As a worker-owned institution, we believe **community matters more than profit.**

### Architectures with Limited or Specialized Support

¹ **Linux on SPARC (glibc)** — pkgsrc builds likely to fail due to missing toolchain components.

² **FreeBSD riscv64** — The kernel runs well on riscv64, but userland packaging is incomplete.

³ **FreeBSD/OpenBSD on POWER, SPARC, or MIPS** — technically possible, but not well supported.

⁴ **Solaris on POWER or MIPS** — No complete runtime environment for that architecture/OS exists.

⁵ **Windows ARM64 (WSL/Cygwin)** — Can run basic Bash environments, but lacks a full POSIX layer.

⁶ **Linux (musl)** — pkgsrc does not play nice with musl.
