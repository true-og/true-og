<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://true-og.net/" target="_blank">TrueOG Network</a> is an independently owned sole proprietorship that operates open-source and community game services. Services are provided by TrueOG Network at no monetary cost to players and are intended for use “as is.”</em></p>
<p>If you choose to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The personal information we collect is used to provide, secure, and improve the Service and to comply with applicable rules (including Mojang / Microsoft policies). We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise defined here, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/true-og/true-og/refs/heads/main/policies/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>TrueOG Network may collect and process certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>E-mail address;</li>
  <li>Minecraft and related usernames and UUIDs;</li>
  <li>IP address and related network metadata (such as approximate country/region derived from IP);</li>
  <li>Payment-related information provided to our payment processors (such as transaction IDs, billing country, and payment method type); and</li>
  <li>In-game activity and server log information needed to operate and moderate the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to provide and maintain the Service, enforce server rules, operate donation systems, prevent abuse (including fraud and chargebacks), enforce geographic availability restrictions, and comply with our obligations under Mojang / Microsoft policies and applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Information and Geo-Restriction</strong><br>
We may use your IP address and related network metadata to derive an approximate geographic location (for example, country or region). This is used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether the Service is available in your region;</li>
  <li>Apply automated IP-based access restrictions where we choose not to operate or cannot provide the Service; and</li>
  <li>Help detect suspicious or abusive activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use this information to infer or make decisions based on your nationality, ethnicity, or religion. Restrictions are applied based on connection information and may occasionally be inaccurate due to the nature of IP-based geolocation.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
TrueOG Network uses third-party services that may collect, store, or process information that can be used to identify you. These third parties have their own privacy policies governing the use of such data.</p>
<p>These providers currently include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/datenschutz" target="_blank">Hetzner GmbH</a> (server hosting and infrastructure)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Account Services</a> (Minecraft account / authentication through Mojang / Microsoft systems)</li>
  <li><a href="https://craftingstore.net/legal/privacy" target="_blank">CraftingStore</a> (storefront)</li>

</ul>
<p>When you interact with these services (for example, when making a purchase), the information you provide may be processed directly by the relevant third party under its own terms and privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Logged Data</strong><br>Whenever you use our web services or game servers, we may collect server logs and related technical data. This may include information such as your IP address, approximate geographic region, device or client type, Minecraft username and UUID, connection timestamps, server commands used, in-game messages (including DMs/Emails)&nbsp;and in-game events.</p>
<p>We use this data to operate and maintain the Service, enforce server rules, diagnose technical issues, investigate abuse, enforce geographic restrictions, and screen for criminal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong><br>
Cookies are small data files that can be used as anonymous unique identifiers. They may be sent to your browser from websites you visit and stored on your device.</p>
<p>TrueOG Network does not intentionally use first-party cookies for tracking on its own simple web pages beyond what is technically necessary. However, third-party services we integrate (such as CraftingStore, PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase,&nbsp;or embedded Microsoft services) may use cookies or similar technologies to operate and improve their services.</p>
<p>You can choose to accept or refuse cookies through your browser settings. If you choose to refuse cookies, some portions of the Service (especially third-party payment or account systems) may not function correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information and strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect it, including restricting direct access to production systems and limiting access to logs and payment information to those who need it to perform their roles.</p>
<p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security for your information. You use the Service and share information with us at your own risk, with knowledge that a security breach is always a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Data Location and International Transfers</strong><br>Our servers are currently hosted by providers including Hetzner GmbH, which is located in Germany under the jurisdiction of the European Union. Your Personal Information may therefore be transferred to and processed in countries outside of your own, which may have different data protection laws from your own.&nbsp;By using the Service, you consent to such transfers and processing.</p>
<p><strong>Retention</strong><br>
We retain Personal Information only for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Service, enforce our Terms of Service, comply with applicable law, resolve disputes, and protect our rights. When information is no longer needed, we will take reasonable steps to delete or anonymize it.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>The Service is not directed to children under the minimum age required by applicable law. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under that age without appropriate consent from their parent or guardian.</p>
<p>If you believe that a child has provided us with information&nbsp;in violation of this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@true-og.net">admin@true-og.net</a> and we will take reasonable steps to delete such information as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by TrueOG Network. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of any site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong><br>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date below. Your continued use of the Service after any changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><em>This policy is effective as of: <strong>2025-12-02</strong></em></p>
