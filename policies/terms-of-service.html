<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p><em>By using any game server, website, store, or related service operated by <strong>TrueOG Network</strong> (the “Service”), including by making a donation, you agree to the following terms.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Who We Are</strong><br>
TrueOG Network is an independently owned and operated sole proprietorship. It is not owned by, operated by, endorsed by, or affiliated with Mojang AB, Microsoft, or any of their affiliates. “Minecraft” and all related names, brands, and assets are the property of Mojang AB and Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>2. Relationship to Mojang / Microsoft Policies</strong><br>
Your use of the Service requires a valid, properly licensed copy of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc" target="_blank">Minecraft: Java Edition</a> and continued compliance with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula" target="_blank">Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines" target="_blank">Minecraft Usage Guidelines and Commercial Usage Guidelines</a>; and</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement" target="_blank">Microsoft Services Agreement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any feature of the Service or any rank benefit conflicts with these Mojang / Microsoft terms or guidelines, TrueOG Network may modify, suspend, or remove such features or benefits at any time, including for existing customers, in order to remain compliant.</p>
<p><strong>3. Geographic Availability and IP-Based Restrictions</strong><br>
</p>
<p>TrueOG Network does not make the Service available in all countries or regions. Access to the Service (including game servers and donation systems) is currently not offered to users whose connections appear to originate from certain jurisdictions where we choose not to operate or where we believe we cannot provide the Service for technical, compliance, or risk-related reasons. At this time, these restricted jurisdictions include connections that appear to originate from China or Israel.</p>

<p>To enforce these restrictions, we may use automated methods such as IP-based geolocation, firewall rules, and other technical controls. These methods are approximate and may occasionally be inaccurate. Restrictions are applied based on connection information (such as IP address and related network metadata), not on a player’s nationality, ethnicity, or religion.</p>
<p>If our systems determine that your connection originates in a restricted region, you may be blocked from accessing the Service or from making purchases and donations. You are responsible for complying with any laws applicable to you when attempting to access or use the Service.</p>

  <li>Charging back a payment, disputing a payment without valid cause, or using false or unauthorized payment details may result in a permanent ban from the Service, with at most one appeal opportunity at the sole discretion of TrueOG Network.</li>
  <li>The price, contents, and availability of any donor package or in-game benefit may be changed or discontinued at any time, with or without notice, including for existing donors, particularly if required by Mojang / Microsoft policies or by applicable law.</li><li>All purchases and donor benefits are non-transferable between accounts and/or individuals.</li>
